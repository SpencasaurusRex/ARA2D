Things that need to be refactored

-File System-

ARA2D should contain folders for each feature
Each feature should contain a systems folder, a components folder and other miscellaneous classes the belong to the feature

For example:
	Commands\
		Components\
			RawCommandScript.cs
			CommandScript.cs
		Systems\
			CommandParser.cs
			CommandRunner.cs
		Command.cs

The command system is already setup like this, but we should change remaining files to reflect this structure
In addition, once the file system is set up in this fashion, each feature should have a documentation file 
that describes processes at play and how the systems and components work together to achieve it

-True ECS-
We should move towards moving a more "true" ECS approach, where Systems don't keep track of any variables between frames.
Using this approach makes our code cleaner, more maintainable, makes serialization a breeze, and makes all systems more easily unit tested
